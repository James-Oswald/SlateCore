 * at the formula level, i.e. there exists a quantifier that binds it, otherwise it is a constant.
 * Functions here at the term representational level are just constants with an arity. A function
 * is considered to be a function variable if it is bound at the formula level to a quantifier.
 * 
 * I.E. In this code and documentation we refer to any term with 0 arity (args of length 0) as a "constant"
 * and anything with >0 args as a function, regardless of if they are actually a variable due to being bound
 * at the formula level.
